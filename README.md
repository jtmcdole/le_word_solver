# le_word_solver

This is a demonstration flutter application. It uses frequency scores to
generate good first and second guesses with a large spread of characters
to narrow down possible solutions.

A good first and second guess pair is: `raise` and `clout` because they cover
10 out of 26 of the alphabet, all at the higher end of the spectrum.

Got ideas for improvements? File and issue or send me a pull request!
